# Movie Recommender System

![Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System repository! This project focuses on building a content-based recommendation system for movies. It leverages Python and various libraries to recommend movies based on their content features.

## Overview

The content-based recommendation system analyzes the attributes of movies such as genre, cast, director, and plot keywords to suggest similar movies. This approach is based on the assumption that if a user likes a particular movie, they are likely to enjoy movies with similar characteristics.

## Features

- **Content Analysis**: Analyze movie attributes like genre, cast, director, and plot keywords.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Calculate similarity scores between movies based on their content features.
- **Recommendation Generation**: Generate personalized movie recommendations for users based on their preferences.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/himanshudash132/Movie-Recommender-System---content-based-Recommender-System.git


## Install dependencies:


## Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the recommender system:


##Copy code
python recommender.py
Access the recommendations in the generated output.

## Dataset
The MovieLens dataset is commonly used for building recommendation systems. You can find the dataset used in this project in the data directory.

## Usage
To use the recommendation system:

Provide input about a movie you like.
The system will analyze its content features.
Based on the analysis, it will recommend similar movies.
Next Steps
Enhance the recommendation system by:

Incorporating user feedback to improve recommendations over time.
Experimenting with different similarity metrics to enhance accuracy.
Scaling the system to handle larger datasets efficiently.
